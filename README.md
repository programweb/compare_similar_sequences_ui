# Compare similar DNA or Protein Sequences using Web Interfaces
URL PATH: compare_similar_sequences_ui


Here we will compare protein sequences.  The Gene EXOSC2 expresses: exosome component 2 â€” an exoribonuclease complex that participates in degradation and processing of cellular RNA.  It is a Ribosomal RNA-processing Protein.  Exosome component 2 is composed of a precisely-folded polypeptide chain with an amino acid sequence coded in the gene EXOSC2 of the DNA in chromosome 9 at position q34.

To compare with another protein we will use the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST).

## EXOSC2 Gene - Exosome Component 2    2NN6

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

We obtain the FASTA for the protein showing the code for the Amino Acids, and enter this in blastp (rather than the 'n' for nucleotides).
Enter the FASTA sequence, add a "Job Title" of your choosing, and check "Align two or more sequences" as follows:

&nbsp;

We want to compare this proteins sequence with a similar protein.
&nbsp;

One way to find a similar protein is to use NCBI BLAST+ and do a "Protein Similarity Search"
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Check only the FASTA files you want, in this case only the first one, and under "Entries" click "Download" fasta.
This will download a FASTA file to the location of your choosing on your workstation or, if the information is not too great, open in the browser.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

All the data from the download can be entered as the "Subject Sequence" then click the "BLAST" button

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Eventually, you will get a results page.  From here click the "Alignments" tab:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

This is our result after we clicked the "Alignments" tab.   We see that the proteins are indeed similar save for the 26 amino acid gap between the two:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

There is a "graphics" link that you can take to see the same data displayed graphically:
